DragonPy 2020 Code of Conduct __tl;dr__:

>Be respectful of other people, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered,
and if you can't resolve an issue contact staff. If you are being a problem, it will be apparent and you'll be asked to leave.

## Respect

DragonPy is an positive community that recognizes and celebrates the creativity and collaboration of creators and the diversity of people, cultures, and opinions that they bring to DragonPy.

DragonPy events are an inclusive environment, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender (including transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, medical conditions, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or software preferences.

We value respectful behavior above individual opinions.

Respectful behavior includes:

* Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
* Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
* If you're not sure, ask someone instead of assuming.

## Resolve Peacefully

We believe peer to peer discussions, feedback, corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to respectfully discourage them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful and welcome your input in doing so.

If you experience disrespectful behavior and feel in any way unable to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of an organizer. We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just icky in any way. We will listen and work to resolve the matter.

## Apologize for Mistakes

Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them, and avoiding repeating them in the future.

## Contact Information
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff. Their names are found here under __Signed__ section, they will be circulating in the crowd,
and are easy to find.

If the matter is especially urgent, please call/contact:
TBD

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

## Consequences

If the organizers determine that an event participant is behaving disrespectfully, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion and exclusion from the event.

As organizers, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. We can't foresee every situation however, and thus if in the organizers' judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, we will do so. We've never had to do so; please don't be the first.
