# Sprints

After the conference weekend we'll have three days of [sprints](https://python-sprints.github.io/).

A *sprint* is an event where open source programmers meet, and work together on new versions of open source software. Traditionally, sprints mainly happened at the end of conferences, such as the one taking place after DragonPy.

Proposed sprint topics:
* Django
* Flask
* Plone
* Pyramid
* bring your own topic!

The location will be decided at around end of March based on the number of sprinters. Coffee and snacks will be provided and we're doing our best to secure enough [sponsors](https://dragonpy.com/sponsors) to even cover lunch and/or dinner for all sprinters!
