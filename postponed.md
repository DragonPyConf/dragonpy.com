# DragonPy is postponed until a later time
(18 June 2020)

It has been a challenging few months for the World. With restrictions lifting in Europe, we’ve re-examined our options for organizing DragonPy 2020 in the fall. What we’ve discovered is that it’s currently not possible to have an event of our size (~300 people) in a closed space in a way that would be safe and at the same time enjoyable for the participants. It’s also not possible to reliably forecast what kind of restrictions will be in place in a few months and if speakers and participants will even be able to safely travel to and from the conference.

With all this in mind, we’ve decided to postpone the conference for now indefinitely. Once it becomes safer to travel and gather inside, we will hopefully be able to organize it again.

We’ll be issuing full refunds to all the participants and sponsors.

We would like to thank everyone that supported us in the last year, speakers that were willing to come to speak and share their knowledge, and sponsors that believed in a community event.

If you have any questions please email us at [info@dragonpy.com](info@dragonpy.com) and we'll try to address them.
