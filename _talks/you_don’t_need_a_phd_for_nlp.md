## Abstract
Social sciences have studied how ideological bias of news organizations influences the framing of news using content analysis of data collected through the cumbersome process of hand-coding news articles. Python offers a way to automate this process making it quicker, more accurate and reproducible.

## Description
The first part of the talk will look at the problem: what is meant by media bias and how is it measured? We will review the relevant literature from the social sciences on this problem. From there we will discuss how these processes can be automated and made more robust using existing python tools, with a walk through of how we achieved the results.

This talk will demonstrate useful Python libraries, frameworks and tools that can enable just about anyone to examine media bias. We will present a sample project that we worked on as a proof of concept of using NLP to automate a study of media portrayal of environmental groups in the UK and the US and how that has changed over time. 


We will discuss the Python libraries and tools we used for web scraping (Beautiful Soup and scrapy), to collect data from several English language websites. 

We then talk about how we used TextBlob and NLTK (a python natural language toolkit to analyze reading human language data) to analyze the data and build models.

Finally we talk about how to visualize the data using matplotlib (a low level library with a matlab interface) and share our learnings from the results.

At the end of this talk, attendees will gain a better understanding of the possibilities.
