## Abstract
Social sciences have studied how ideological bias of news organizations influences the framing of news using content analysis of data collected through the cumbersome process of hand-coding news articles. Python offers a way to automate this process making it quicker, more accurate and reproducible.

## Description
What is media bias and how is it measured? 

This talk will demonstrate useful Python libraries, frameworks and tools that can enable just about anyone to examine media bias. As an example, I will present a study of how the media portrayal of environmental groups in the UK and the US changed over time.

We will discuss the Python libraries and tools we used for web scraping, for analyzing data, building models and visualizing the results.
