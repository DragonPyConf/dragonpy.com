## Abstract
Did you hear about Python type annotations? They are a great way to write fewer tests and not to worry about what data is and they also enhance coding experience while developing. But the biggest benefit is that they will help you think about your code on another level.

## Description
I've learned most of the programing discipline through old Python 2.7. When I've started learning other languages I was surprised how much types helped during all phases of software development. When Python 3.5 was released I could not be more excited as I was thinking this is it Python has now types, but I had to wait till Python 3.7 to really start using them. In this talk, I will explain the benefits of using type annotations, present libraries, and tools that enhance the development experience even more.

## Bio
I'm a pragmatic programming polyglot who also likes new and shiny things. I like to take things apart and play with them, I think that's a great way to learn about things in general.
