## Abstract
Did you doubt that your one commit matters at all? Let's check it, for the most popular open source Python projects. Using plotly and PyGithub we are going to check how many small contributions are there and what part they take in the whole project. Maybe even this one tiny fix matters.

## Description
## Intro

I always wonder if it is worth to create one commit to open source project. Does this commit matter at all in thousands of others made by some top contributors? In this presentation I want to show that open source are made not only by full time contributors but also "a few commit contributors" take big part of project. I'm going to show what part of the whole project small contributors take. I want to show distribution amount of commits per contributor for a few big open source Python projects. In the end I want to share my conclusions, that each commit matters, because a small ant builds an anthill.

## Plan

- Define "small contributor"
- Introduction of plotly and PyGithub
- Show distribution of commits per contributor
- Distribution for top (biggest) Python projects
- Conclusions

## Audience

All people who are interested in open source or want to start their journey with open source and still have a doubts.

## What they learn

- Even one commit matters in big projects
- How easy it is to start plotly and PyGithub
- What part of project rely on small contributors
