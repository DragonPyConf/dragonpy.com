## Abstract
Async is all the craze these days, but it might be intimidating because you hear it's complicated.
Luckily for us, there are a lot of frameworks out there that will help us writing async code: join to see how to write your first async microservice!

## Description
While not exactly new, async programming has arrived quite recently in the Python core. This enabled to create a wide ecosystem of async-first or async-enabled libraries and frameworks that makes async programming more available to the everyday developer. Writing an async microservice is a good way to get your hands dirty with async programming: we’ll see how to write one using FastAPI (and Starlette under it), including OpenAPI documentation, tests. Just to add a little spice on it, it will not be a boring TODO application, but we’ll create a search API on top of an ElasticSearch server to solve some real-world problems.
