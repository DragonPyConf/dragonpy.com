## Abstract
Tired of blockchain, quant jobs or sports betting gigs? If yes, how about using your Python skills to better the entire society?

## Description
Since the sequencing of the human genome, which was a monumental achievement in human history, the amount of data related to genetics and related fields has been growing at a very fast pace. So fast, indeed, that computers are barely keeping up and humans surely are not. Sheer volume and speed of data generation have caused a vacuum in knowledge and number of people that can handle processing and understanding this data.

In my talk, I would like to introduce work done by an average/mean bioinformatician and talk about how Python has become a major player enabling us to tackle problems in biology, genetics, pharmacology and medicine. 

We will be digging into some prominent cases where bioinformatics played a visible role in solving interesting world problems. We'll look at the ebola outbreaks, at estimating animal population sizes, at the zika virus and more. I hope I can inspire the audience and perhaps encourage some to think of bioinformatics as a viable career option.

## Bio
Roman set out to become a veterinarian, has diverged to biology where he studies animals _in silico_. He is now working as a bioinformatician at Genialis. His first love is and will always be R (maybe). In his spare time, he does 18:6 intermittent fasting, but you can also talk to him about cats or competition shooting.
