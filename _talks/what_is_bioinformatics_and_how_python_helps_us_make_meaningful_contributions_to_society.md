## Abstract
Tired of blockchain, quant jobs or sports betting gigs? If yes, how does using your Python and other domain skills to better the entire society sound?

## Description
Since the sequencing of the human genome, which was a monumental achievement in human history, the amount of data related to genetics and related fields has been growing at a very fast pace. So fast, indeed, that computers are barely keeping up and humans surely are not. Sheer volume and speed of data generation has caused a vacuum in knowledge and number of people that can handle processing and understanding this data.

With the development of biology and technologies that enable us to poke around samples at an atomic or molecular level, so developed a yet another profession. Thus, a bioinformatician was born. What are responsibilities of a bioinformatician can depend on whom you ask. This is a lively debate, but this author prefers to be inclusive and will use the most broad definition and set the academic pedantry aside for now.

A neonate bioinformatician started working with megabytes of data to understand biological processes, causes of disease and more. This is done by employing knowledge from at least computer science, IT, statistics and biology. In recent years, the list of responsibilities has grown considerably, and so has the amount of data and its complexity. It is daunting to set up infrastructure, tools and process data on its own, let alone understand the results, comprehend the limitations and assumptions that come with the territory as well as form further hypotheses.

In my talk, I would like to introduce work done by an average/mean bioinformatician in a way that will hopefully be understood by people from predominantly computer science background and talk about how Python has become a major player enabling us to tackle problems in biology, genetics, pharmacology and medicine. Showing tools and pages and pages of code and analyses would be boring AF so I thought digging into some prominent cases where bioinformatics played a visible role in solving interesting world problems (think ebola outbreaks, estimating animal population sizes, remember zika virus? and more) would inspire audience and perhaps encourage people to think of bioinformatics as a viable career option.

## Bio
Roman set out to become a veterinarian, has diverged to biology where he studies animals _in silico_. He is now working as a bioinformatician at Genialis. His first love is and will always be R (maybe). In his spare time, he does 18:6 intermittent fasting, but you can also talk to him about cats or competition shooting.
