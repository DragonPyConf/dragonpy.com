# Sponsor DragonPy 2020

DragonPy is a 2-day conference organized by a community of passionate Pythonistas on a volunteer basis. We can't put on a great show without some great sponsors. Here is your chance to reach the decision makers and developers from the area.

DragonPy has a capacity of 300+ attendees and there are sponsorship opportunities to fit any budget. Be part of the first Python conference in Slovenia!

## Why Sponsor?

* Increase brand awareness in the Python, Web and Data Science communities.
* Find new employees within the highly motivated, skilled and interested participants.
* Support your employees to grow into better developers by learning from a lineup of great speakers.
* Give back to the community that you rely on. Ensure a bright future for Python locally and globally.
